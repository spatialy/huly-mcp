/**
 * Test factory functions for branded and phantom types.
 *
 * Branded types from Effect Schema and phantom types from the Huly SDK
 * have no runtime constructors. In test code, the only way to create
 * values of these types is via type assertion. These helpers centralize
 * the casts so test files stay clean.
